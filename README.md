📊 **Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard
📌 Problem Statement**

The objective of this project is to develop a strong understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and demonstrate how data-driven insights can be leveraged to minimize credit risk and reduce potential financial losses during the lending process.

💡** Solution Overview**

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed using modern visualization and analytics techniques to support loan approval decision-making.
The dashboard evaluates applicant profiles based on financial behavior, engagement history, and income bands to help identify creditworthy customers who are more likely to repay loans, thereby reducing default risk.

🗂️** Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of banking and customer-level information organized across multiple relational tables, connected using primary and foreign keys.

**Key Tables Included:**

Banking Relationship

Client–Banking

Gender

Investment Advisor

Period

These tables collectively capture client demographics, banking engagement, loan activity, deposits, and advisory relationships.

🛠️** Tools & Technologies Used**

Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL – Database querying and data extraction

Python – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard development

📈** Dashboards Created**

Summary Dashboard – High-level overview of key banking KPIs

Loan Analysis Dashboard – Loan distribution, risk indicators, and income segmentation

Deposit Analysis Dashboard – Deposit behavior across account types and customer segments

📊 **Key Business Recommendations**

Prioritize low-risk customers: Clients with engagement tenure greater than 3 years show 25–30% lower default risk and stronger repayment behavior.

Target mid-income applicants (₹100K–₹300K): This segment contributes nearly 45% of total loan volume while maintaining healthier deposit-to-loan ratios.

Strengthen private banking strategies: Private banks represent ~60% of total clients and generate 35% higher fee revenue compared to public banks.

Cross-sell deposit products to loan-heavy customers: Customers with savings and checking accounts hold ~40% higher total deposits, improving liquidity coverage.

Optimize processing fees: A 5% processing fee on high-loan portfolios contributes 15–20% of non-interest revenue, enhancing profitability without increasing credit exposure.

✅** Conclusion**

Powered by modern data modeling and visualization capabilities, Power BI dashboards serve as a powerful decision-support tool in the banking sector.
This project demonstrates how key banking KPIs, customer engagement metrics, and risk indicators can be combined into a centralized dashboard to enable smarter lending decisions, improved profitability, and reduced credit risk.
